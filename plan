OSC says: Tools are NOT Talent - Money != Success - integrity cannot be bought
  - consume the minimum, produce the maximum - talk is a poor substitute for
  action - create yourself before someone else does - don't do what people tell
  you to do - trust your heart - confront and document - believe nothing -
  finish things and give them to people
